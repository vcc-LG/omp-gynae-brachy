# Brachytherapy protocol generator

## Introduction

This application produces radiographer protocols for brachytherapy treatments using data pulled from the OMP database.

## Details

I have used Django/Jinja2 and our in-house code for connecting to and querying the OMP database.

## Usage

Activate the virtual environment and start the server:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) python manage.py runserver
```

And open a browser to: [localhost:8000](localhost:8000)

## Tests

Tests cover the pyTG43 calculation itself as well as the views, protocol generation, and dose check display:

```
(venv) python manage.py test
```

And view test coverage with:

```
(venv) coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
(venv) coverage report
```
